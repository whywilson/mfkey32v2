# Mfkey32 for MTools Lite
Mfkey32 function are imported to MTools Lite App to support detect Mifare Keys for the ChameleonUltra and the ChameleonLite devices. MTools Lite App is based on Flutter and using Bluetooth to connect the Chameleon Device. The related code to implement mfkey32 are under folder `dart`.

# Mfkey32 Version 2
Mfkey32v2 is a tool used to calculate Mifare Classic Keys from encrypted nonces obtained from the reader. 

**Note: Nonce in computer terminology means "Number used once"**

## What is Mfkey32v2
Mfkey32v2 calculates Mifare Classic Sector keys from encrypted nonces collected by emulating the initial card and recording the interaction between the emulated card and the respective reader. 

While performing authentication, the reader will send "nonces" to the card which can be decrypted into keys. 

**Mfkey32v2 is not magic it cannot create you a working credential without an initial card. The Keys generated are not keys to open the door, they are keys to unlock and read sectors from inside the card itself.**

## Collecting Nonces with the FlipperZero 
1. After scanning your mifare classic and verifying you do not have all sector keys, save the file. 
2. Navigate to NFC -> Saved -> [Your File] -> detect reader 
3. Approach reader with flipperzero and observe nonces being collected. 
4. Once collected you can move on to cracking, see below the different methods (NOTE: They all do the same thing just in different ways)
